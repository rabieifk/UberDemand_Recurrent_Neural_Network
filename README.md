# UberDemand_Recurrent_Neural_Network
Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs for prediction in UberDemand dataset

One of the applications of [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) is Forecasting. In this project, the intention is to predict the number of uber online taxi calls in four parts of New York City for an upcoming hour with Recurrent Neural Networks.

The data enclosed with the name UberDemand.csv includes the number of requests for each section per hour, as well as weather and time information to improve the accuracy of prediction to the data has been added. Each row contains weather information for an hour. The information is from January 1 to June 30, 2015, and the rows in each section of the city are recorded in order of time per hour.

[RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) and [GRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) are the networks that can use in prediction. 

[Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/) is a library which is used in the project.
